Searching mods on ModCabinet is unfortunately not super straightforward, since
GitHub doesn't search wikis by default.  In order to search for something, you
should follow this procedure:

**1. Put in your search terms like you'd expect**

This is what you've almost certainly already tried:

**2. Click on "Wikis" to get the wiki results**

Once you've done your search, there are almost certainly no results found, but you
may notice that there'll be a number next to the "Wikis" link on the left.  Click
on "Wikis" to get the results that were found inside the wiki:

**3. Now you have results!**

At this point, you'll have the actual results you were (hopefully) looking for:

**4. That's it.**

I've been looking for a way to make this happen by default so you don't have to do
extra clicking, but haven't found a way yet.  If you have any ideas, please let
us know!
