Welcome!

The BL3 ModCabinet wiki exists to provide a slightly-easier way of browsing through
the Borderlands 3 mods hosted on the
[bl3mods Github](https://github.com/BLCM/bl3mods) -- all nicely arranged in
categories rather than just organized by author.  

Note that in addition to this github, another common place to find BL3
mods is Nexusmods -- you can find some more links to those resources on
[borderlandsmodding.com](http://borderlandsmodding.com/finding-mods/).

This wiki is a resource for users who are just looking to run some mods.
For information on actually building your own mods, the [BLCMods
Wiki](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/wiki) is your best starting point.
The Borderlands 3-specific pages are categorized near the bottom.
